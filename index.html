----------------------------- Git & Github *---------------------------


1. git config --global user.name "your name" => to set the username for git.


2. git config --global user.email "your email" => to set the email for git.


3. First create new repository on github with README.md file 


4. After creating go into the repository then arrow click the code button to copy HTTPS link.


5. Then Create new folder in the desktop and open it in VSCODE.


6. After opening it in VSCODE open new terminal either command or gitbash.


7. After opening new terminal either command/gitbash go into that folder via cmd (cd <new folder>)


8. After going into that folder clone that repository that  you created on github via HTTPS link
     i.e (git clone <HTTPS LINK>)


9. After cloning you will see that the repository that you created will be on new folder.


10. ls 	(list an item)


11. ls -a 	(list all hidden item)


12. git status => Shows the status of a file that updated, deleted, created etc..


13. Untracked files => new files that github is unable to track 


14. After modifying, deleting any code in the file then first it must be add then commit 

    i.e (git add <filename>) then (git commit -m "message")
    (consider an example:- first engagement then Wedding) 


15. You can add single file using cmd (git add <filename>) that you made changes in 
        or all files in one cmd (git add .)
        

16. then you can check via cmd (git status) it shows all the files that are added/staged.

        // if you want to check the changes in the file then you can use cmd (git diff <filename>) 
        // it shows the changes that you made in the file.


17. Now, staged files are ready to commit via command (git push origin main) 
        // if you are using gitbash then you can use (git push) cmd line to push the files into github repository. 
        // if you are using cmd line then you have to use (git push origin main) cmd line to push the files into github repository. 
        // if not linked vs code with github then you have to linked first after both account linked 
        you can check the cmd line that all new files are pushed into github repository from vscode  


18. you can go back from directory via (cd ..)


19. you can create new folder via cmd line (mkdir <filename>)

    // if you want to create new folder inside the existing folder then you can use cmd line (mkdir <foldername>/<subfoldername>)
    i.e (mkdir <foldername>/<subfoldername>) then you can check via cmd line (ls -a) to see if it is created or not.
        // if you want to delete the folder then you can use cmd line (rm -rf <foldername>)
        // if you want to delete the file then you can use cmd line (rm <filename>)
        // if you want to rename the file then you can use cmd line (mv <old-filename> <new-filename>)
        // if you want to move the file then you can use cmd line (mv <filename> <new-directory>)
        // if you want to copy the file then you can use cmd line (cp <filename> <new-filename>)
        // if you want to move the folder then you can use cmd line (mv <foldername> <new-directory>)
        // if you want to copy the folder then you can use cmd line (cp -r <foldername> <new-directory>)
        // if you want to see the content of the file then you can use cmd line (cat <filename>)


20. After creating any directory you have to initialised first via cmd line (git init) the you can check
    if it is listed or not by (ls -a) cmd line

    // if you want to check the status of the file then you can use cmd line (git status) to see if it is initialised or not.


21. clear => is a cmd line to clear the line.

22. git log => to see the history of the commit that you made in the file.

23. git log --oneline => to see the history of the commit in one line.

24. git reset HEAD <filename> => to reset the file to the previous commit.

25. git reset HEAD~1 => to reset the last commit.

26. git reset HEAD~2 => to reset the last two commit.

27. git checkout <commit-hash> => to go to any specific commit.

28. git checkout -b <branch-name> => to create a new branch.

29. git branch => to see all the branches.

30. git checkout <branch-name> => to switch to a different branch.

31. git merge <branch-name> => to merge the branch into the current branch.

32. git pull => to pull the changes from the remote repository.

33. git push => to push the changes to the remote repository.

34. git push origin <branch-name> => to push the changes to the remote repository.

35. git remote add origin <remote-repo-url> => to add a remote repository.

36. git remote -v => to see the remote repository.
